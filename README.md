## exec command
```
$ kubectl exec <pod-name> date
$ kubetcl exec -it <pod-name> /bin/bash
$ kubetcl exec <pod-name> -c <container-name> date
```
## Pod
Pod is a basic entity in Kubernetes.
A pod can only one container in it and other containers can be helper containers.
```
$ kubectl run nginx --image=nginx
$ kubectl get pods
$ kubectl get pods -o wide
$ kubectl describe pod nginx
```
YAML for pod
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata: 
  name: myapp-pod
  labels:
    app: myapp
    type: frontend
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx
      
>> kubectl create -f pod-definition.yml
```
Trick - To get dryrun of pod definition
```
$ kubectl run redis image=redis --dry-run=client -o yaml > pod.yaml
```
Trick - To get yaml of a object
```
$ kubectl get pod nginx-pod -o yaml
```
Trick - To edit pod definition
```
$ kubectl edit pod redis
$ kubectl replace -f pod.yaml (To get back the changes to yaml file)
```
Trick - To get the updated yaml file from etcd
```
$ kubectl get deployment nginx-deployment -o yaml > nginx-dep.yaml
```
Tip
```
We can have multiple definitions of object in one yaml file sepearted by "---"
```
## Replica Controller
Run multiple instances of a pod in kubernetes cluster for high availability. Replication controller always maintains a specified pods running. Another reason is for load balancing and scaling. If load increases on a single node then we expand load on multiple containers

#### Note: Replication controller is older technology and Replica set is a new way to set up the replication
YAML
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet 
metadata:
  name: myapp-replicaset
  labels:
    app: myapp
    type: frontend
spec:
  template:
    metadata: 
      name: myapp-pod
      labels:
        app: myapp
        type: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx-container
          image: nginx
    
  replicas: 6
  selector:
    matchLabels: 
      type: front-end
  
  >> kubectl create -f replicaset.yaml
  >> kubetcl get replicaset
  >> kubectl get pods
  >> kubectl delete replicaset myapp-replicaset

```
#### Note: The spec section contains definition of pod, so directly take from it. Selector is a necessary tag needed because replication controller can controller other pods as well. Selector tag is not present in replicationcontroller but it is present in replicationset.

#### Update Replicaset to increase replica count
1. Increase replica count
2. Run >> kubectl replace -f rs.yaml

Or directly use a kubernetes command to scale it
>> kubectl scale replicaset myapp-replicaset --replicas=2

Or 
>> kubectl edit replicaset myapp-replicaset

## Deployment
Deployment comes higher in hierarchy after replicaset. It is for rolling updates and upgrads.

YAML
To create a yaml file, take replicaset definition and just change kind to Deployment.
>> kubectl create -f deployment.yml
>> kubectl get deployments
>> kubectl get replicaset
>> kubectl get pods
>> kubectl get all   (Get all deployments,replicaset,pods)  

## Rollout
A new rollout creates a new deployment. If in future new updates is released then new deployment is craeted
```
>> kubectl rollout status deployment/myapp-dep
>> kubectl rollout history deployment/my-app
>> kubectl rollout undo deployment/myapp
```
### Deployment strategies
1. Recreate: In this strategy all containers are done down and then new containers are made up. But because of these there is application downtime
2. Rolling updates(Default deployment strategy): In this strategy the containers are taken down and new are brought up one by one while upgrading. So there is no downtime.

### Services
Services helps in communications. Communication between frontend and backend pods and frontend with outside world.
Types of Services:
1. NodePort: This service is accesssible to external user through a port. The service has port, The container port is TargetPort and outsite port is NodePort. NodePort is in the range of 30000-32767
YAML
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata: 
  name: myapp-service
specs:
  type: NodePort
  ports: 
  - targetPort: 80
    port: 80
    nodePort: 30008
  selector:
    app: myapp
    type: front-end
    
 >> kubectl create -f service.yaml
 >> kubectl get services
```
2. ClusterIP: This creates a network so that it communicated between frontend and backend services
YAML
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
 name: backend
specs:
 type: ClusterIP
 ports:
 - targerPort: 80
   port: 80
 selector:
   app: myapp
   type: backend

```
3. LoadBalancer: 

### Namespace
There are different namespaces craeted by kubernetes
1. Default: 
2. kube-system: It is used by kubernetes to create internal objects like DNS
3. kube-public: Here resources for all users are created

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: my-namespace
>> kubectl create -f namespace.yaml
Or
>> kubectl create namespace my-dev
>> kubectl get pods --namespace=mydev
>> kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
```
### Imperative vs Declarative
Imperative: In imperative way we declare the steps to achieve the goal. Eg. kubectl create, kubectl get, kubectl scale
Declarative: In declarative way we dont give steps but leave it itself to figure it out. Eg. kubectl apply

### Scheduler
Scheduler will schedule the pods on nodes as per resources needed to schedule them. 
- When pods are not running or in pending state then check if scheduler is running
```
$ kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system  (All components pods are running in kube-system namespace)
```
- Schedule pods manually by adding nodeName: nodename property in pod definition yaml file. 
  Note: Pods can be scheduled on nodes before creating them. So if they are craeted then delete them, then add nodeName property and then run yaml file
  ```
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: nginx
  spec:
    nodeName: node01
    containers:
    -  image: nginx
       name: nginx
  ```
  ### Labels and Selectors
  ```
  >> kubectl get pods --selector env=dev
  ```
  ### Taints and Tolerance - it tells nodes to accept pods with ceratin toleration
  When the scheduler places the pods on nodes then we need to place certain pods on a certain node then we paint the nodes with taint. By default pods are intolerent so they are not scheduled on that nodes, If we give pods tolerant to that taint then they will schedule on that pods.
  ```
  Taint to Nodes
  >> kubectl taint nodes node-name key=value:taint-effect
  Example
  >> kubectl taint nodes node1 app=blue:NoSchedule
  ```
  Taint effect is what happens to PODs that do not tolerate this taint. Taint effect can be NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule, NoExecute
  Tolaration to Pods
  ```
  In yaml of pod definition add below field 
  spec:
    tolerations:
    - key: "app"
      opeartor: "Equal"
      value: "blue"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
  ```
  Note: Pods are never scheduled on master node as they are tainted.
  To untaint the node
  ```
  >> kubectl taint nodes controlplane node-role.kubernetes.io/master:NoSchedule-
  ```
  ### Node Selector
  Label Nodes
  ```
  >> kubectl label nodes <node-name> <label-key>=<label-value>
  >> kubectl label nodes node-1 size=large
  ```
  ### Node Affinity
  Provides advanced features to place a pod on node
