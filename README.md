## Pod
Pod is a basic entity in Kubernetes.
A pod can only one container in it and other containers can be helper containers.
```
$ kubectl run nginx --image=nginx
$ kubectl get pods
$ kubectl get pods -o wide
$ kubectl describe pod nginx
```
YAML for pod
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata: 
  name: myapp-pod
  labels:
    app: myapp
    type: frontend
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx
      
>> kubectl create -f pod-definition.yml
```
Trick - To get dryrun of pod definition
```
$ kubectl run redis image=redis --dry-run=client -o yaml > pod.yaml
```
Trick - To edit pod definition
```
$ kubectl edit pod redis
```
Trick - To get the updated yaml file from etcd
```
$ kubectl get deployment nginx-deployment -o yaml > nginx-dep.yaml
```
Tip
```
We can have multiple definitions of object in one yaml file sepearted by "---"
```
## Replica Controller
Run multiple instances of a pod in kubernetes cluster for high availability. Replication controller always maintains a specified pods running. Another reason is for load balancing and scaling. If load increases on a single node then we expand load on multiple containers

#### Note: Replication controller is older technology and Replica set is a new way to set up the replication
YAML
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet 
metadata:
  name: myapp-replicaset
  labels:
    app: myapp
    type: frontend
spec:
  template:
    metadata: 
      name: myapp-pod
      labels:
        app: myapp
        type: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx-container
          image: nginx
    
  replicas: 6
  selector:
    matchLabels: 
      type: front-end
  
  >> kubectl create -f replicaset.yaml
  >> kubetcl get replicaset
  >> kubectl get pods
  >> kubectl delete replicaset myapp-replicaset

```
#### Note: The spec section contains definition of pod, so directly take from it. Selector is a necessary tag needed because replication controller can controller other pods as well. Selector tag is not present in replicationcontroller but it is present in replicationset.

#### Update Replicaset to increase replica count
1. Increase replica count
2. Run >> kubectl replace -f rs.yaml

Or directly use a kubernetes command to scale it
>> kubectl scale replicaset myapp-replicaset --replicas=2

Or 
>> kubectl edit replicaset myapp-replicaset

## Deployment
Deployment comes higher in hierarchy after replicaset. It is for rolling updates and upgrads.

YAML
To create a yaml file, take replicaset definition and just change kind to Deployment.
>> kubectl create -f deployment.yml
>> kubectl get deployments
>> kubectl get replicaset
>> kubectl get pods
>> kubectl get all   (Get all deployments,replicaset,pods)
